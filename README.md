Hi! It's Ayse. I'm a business school graduate and an entrepreneur who developed and sold game bots using Java for 5 year. 🎮
It was so much fun and I learnt a lot! 🥸
But I was so fascinated working with data when I was in school. 👩‍💻
I left my programming bots journey and started learning Python to improve my skills in machine learning and deep learning to become a data scientist. 
Currently I'm reading articles, following other data scientists on github to learn as much as I can.
